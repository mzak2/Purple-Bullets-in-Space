# Purple-Bullets-in-Space
About: A simple side-scrolling game made similar to other bullet hell games in the Genre. It has
two modes normal and ludicrous to test various means of difficulty increase through spawn numbers.
This game was made completely from scratch utilizing the skills I learned from Create-with-code on Unity.
I did use free assets as well, credits below.
